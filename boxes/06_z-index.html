  <h1>06 - z-index</h1>

  <p>
    As we saw in the <a href="05_position.html">Position</a> step, when two or more elements are given position,
    and compete for the same 2D space, the browser doesn't know which one to give priority to (and thus show above the others). 
    By default, it favors the DOM element found lowest in the document hierarchy.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may find that changing the order of the elements in the DOM is not desirable, or feasible. 
    Instead, the CSS property <strong>z-index</strong> can be used to raise or lower the element's stacking priority (stacking context). 
    Think of the device screen as a 2D plane (x and y), where z-index changes the stacking order of elements (z).
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are familiar with the idea of <em>layers</em> in Photoshop, z-index behaves the same way; 
    if you raise the the priority of a stacked layer, it comes to the front of view. 
    If you lower it, it recedes behind other layers with a higher priority.
  </p>

    Below, we have two absolutely-positioned elements inside a relative parent, both set to occupy the same position:
  </p>

  <div class="wrap">
    <div class="box" style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0;">Box 1 - <code>position:absolute; top:0; left:0;</code></div>
    <div class="box yellow" style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0;">Box 2 - <code>position:absolute; top:0; left:0;</code></div>
  </div>

  <p>As noted, Box 2 is visible because it comes lower in the document hierarchy.</p>
  
  <p>To fix, we could reorder the box elements, or we can set z-index on Box 1:</p>

  <div class="wrap">
    <div class="box" style="z-index:1; position:absolute; top:0; left:0;">Box 1 - <code>z-index:0; position:absolute; top:0; left:0;</code></div>
    <div class="box yellow" style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0;">Box 2 - <code>position:absolute; top:0; left:0;</code></div>
  </div>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> since the value of <code>0</code> (zero) indicates the default state of the element's local stacking context, 
    you typically see z-index values set starting with <code>1</code> and increasing from there.
  </p>

  <h2>Child elements inside z-indexed parents</h2>

  <p>
    By default, all z-index values compete for the same space:
  </p>

  <div class="wrap">
    <div class="box" style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0;">
      <span>Box 1 - <code>position:absolute; top:0; left:0;</code></span>
      <span style="z-index:3; position:relative; display:block; background:indianred;">z-index:3; Higher z-index child</span>
    </div>
    <div class="box yellow" style="z-index:1; position:absolute; top:0; left:0;">
      <span>Box 2 - <code>z-index:1; position:absolute; top:0; left:0;</code></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Despite Box 2 having a z-index, and Box 1 not, Box 1's child element has a higher z-index set, which is why it appears above Box 2,
    which in turn appears above Box 1.
  </p>

  <p>
    This general competition is severed only if sibling elements both have a z-index set. Once a z-index is set on an element, 
    its child elements get their own local scope, that resets to zero. Therefore, to fix the above example, Box 1 (1) needs a lower z-index set than Box 2 (2). 
    Then, despite Box 1's child element having a higher z-index than Box 2 (3), it doesn't matter because they are not competing in the same scope:
  </p>

  <div class="wrap">
    <div class="box" style="z-index:1; position:absolute; top:0; left:0;">
      <span>Box 1 - <code>z-index:1; position:absolute; top:0; left:0;</code></span>
      <span style="z-index:3; position:relative; display:block; background:indianred;">z-index:3; Higher z-index child</span>
    </div>
    <div class="box yellow" style="z-index:2; position:absolute; top:0; left:0;">
      <span>Box 2 - <code>z-index:2; position:absolute; top:0; left:0;</code></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now the sub-child element doesn't appear, even though it has a higher z-index.</p>

    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Due to z-index scoping, it can quickly become difficult to figure out what is going on. The element you think should be higher up the stack 
        could be failing because its 10th parent element has its own z-index set and is lower than one of its siblings.<br>
        <em>It is highly recommended to avoid z-index unless absolutely necessary, and if all other solutions have been exhausted.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Negative values can be set for <code>z-index</code>, but you may find yourself putting your element behind the document background, etc. 
        Negative values are discouraged.
      </li>
    </ul>
