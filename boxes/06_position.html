  <h1>06 - Position</h1>

  <p>To position elements at an offset to their natural position in the document flow, we use the CSS properties:</p>
  <ul class="compact">
    <li><code>top</code></li>
    <li><code>bottom</code></li>
    <li><code>left</code></li>
    <li><code>right</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    They must be used in conjuction with a specified <code>position</code> type, since the default 
    element position (<code>static</code>) does not honor these offset values. Simply adding <code>top: 10px;</code> 
    to a statically-positioned element will have no visual effect.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, it is important to know that these 4 properties (by themselves) simply offset the element presentationally (visual position on screen). 
    Only the value of its <code>position</code> controls how the content around it behaves.
  </p>

  <p>For both relative and absolutely-positioned elements, a value of <code>top: 10px;</code> will offset the element vertically by 10 pixels.</p>

  <p>
    However, for <em>relative</em> positioned elements, the content below it will not change its location. It is spaced according to the 
    original (non-offset) position of the relative element.
  </p>
  <p>
    For <em>absolute</em> positioned elements, and for the purposes of flowing the content below it, the device treats 
    the element as if it didn't belong in its original (non-offset) position to begin with. In this regard, the content 
    after the element would shift up vertically, to fill the void the element's height filled up.
  </p>

  <p>These, and further positioning differences, are highlighted with demos below.</p>

  <p>There are <strong>5</strong> <code>position</code> variants of note:</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>position: static</h2>

  <p>
    By default, block elements have a position of <strong>static</strong>. This indicates it is in the natural flow of the document content,
    and <strong>unavailable</strong> for positioning. This is important. The above position properties will not affect static elements.
    For example, the below boxes have <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> values applied inline. 
    However, the boxes haven't changed their offset position on screen.
  </p>

  <div class="box" style="top:10px;">Box 1 - <code>top:10px;</code></div>
  <div class="box" style="left:20px;">Box 2 - <code>left:20px;</code></div>

  <p>Therefore, we must first designate the element as a position type, before it will change: <code>.box { position:xxxx; }</code></p>

  <hr>

  <h2>position: relative</h2>

  <p>
    When positioning, you are offsetting the element <strong>relative</strong> to its position within the document flow, not the whole document.
    This is why if you set <code>top:10px;</code>, it only moves vertically 10 pixels from its current location.
  </p>

  <div class="wrap">
    <div class="box" style="position:relative; top:-15px;">Box 1 - <code>position:relative; top:-15px;</code></div>
    <div class="box" style="position:relative; left:20px;">Box 2 - <code>position:relative; left:20px;</code></div>
    <div class="box" style="top:40px; left:20px;">Box 3 - <code>position:static; top:40px; left:20px;</code> - <strong>No Change!</strong></div>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Take a look at <code>Box 2</code>.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>It looks like it gained spacing above it, since it is not adjacent to Box 1, but it did not. 
    It was only offset horizontally due to its directly-applied value of <code>left:20px;</code>. 
    The vertical separation was caused by the <code>top:-15px</code> on Box 1, which was presentationally 
    offset by 15 pixels. If you imagine Box 1 not being offset, you'll see that its original, non-offset, 
    position would be adjacent to the top of Box 2.</li>
    <li>Its width is too wide for the containing box, and part of it extends past the red-border boundary. 
    Because it is just offset, and not moved 'in flow', like <code>margin</code> does, it doesn't know 
    it has pierced the parent's edge, and cannot recalculate its width. Its width <em>is</em> the parent's, 
    you just translated it horizontally.
  </ol>

  <h2>position: absolute</h2>

  <p>
    Unlike relative positioning, when you position absolutely, you are offsetting the element <strong>absolute</strong> to its <em>nearest relatively-positioned ancestor</em>.
    If none is found, the top-left of the document is used (the top-left, or (0,0), of scroll-y position 0).
  </p>

  <p>Take the same example from before, but set <code>Box 1</code> box to absolute positioning:</p>

  <div class="wrap">
    <div class="box" style="position:absolute; top:0; right:0;";>Box 1 - Oops - <code>position:absolute; top:0; right:0;</code></div>
    <div class="box" style="position:relative; left:20px;">Box 2 - <code>position:relative; left:20px;</code></div>
    <div class="box">Box 3</div>
  </div>

  <p>What happended to <em>Box 1</em>! Scroll to the top of the page, and check the upper-right corner. You should see the box.</p>

  <p>
    This absolutely-positioned element's nearest relative parent is the document itself, not the parent wrapper box (which is statically-positioned by default).
    So setting its position to <code>top:0; right:0;</code> places it at the top-right of the document (page).
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, note how Box 2's top position is now flush with the outer red-border wrapper. By absolutely-positioning Box 1, 
    <em>we have removed it from the natural document flow</em>. For onscreen rendering purposes, its as if Box 1 didn't
    exist inside the red-border wrapper.
  </p>

  <p>So how do we fix this?</p>

  <p>
    As we saw in the <code>position:relative</code> section, setting a block container to relative positioning uses its (0,0) point as the offset reference,
    not the document. This is adventageous. By setting the red-border parent wrapper's position to relative, the absolutely-positioned Box 1 is now positioned 
    relative to its parent and not the document itself.
  </p>

  <div class="wrap" style="position:relative;">
    <div class="box" style="position:absolute; top:0; right:0; background:indianred;">Box 1 - Oops - <code>position:absolute; top:0; right:0;</code></div>
    <div class="box" style="position:relative; left:20px;">Box 2 - <code>position:relative; left:20px;</code></div>
    <div class="box">Box 3</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Wait, where is it? Its not at the top of the page, but you don't see it in the the above demo either. 
    If you inspect the above code in Dev Tools, you'll see Box 1 is at the top-right of the wrapper, and not the document, as expected.
    This is because both Box 1 and Box 2 are competing for the same space <em>and</em> both have position set. This is an important distinction.
  </p>

  <p>If Box 2 was still statically positioned, Box 1 would have visual priority, as shown below:</p>

  <div class="wrap" style="position:relative;">
    <div class="box" style="position:absolute; top:0; right:0; background:indianred;">Box 1 - Oops - <code style="color:#fff;">position:absolute; top:0; right:0;</code></div>
    <div class="box" style="position:static; left:20px;">Box 2 - <code>position:static; left:20px;</code></div>
    <div class="box">Box 3</div>
  </div>

  <p>Box 2 has no position set, so Box 1 wins out.</p>

  <p>
    However, since Box 2 does have position set, the browser doesn't know which one gets priority, so it defaults to the last element defined in the document tree.
    In this case, Box 2 wins out.
  </p>

  <p>If we were to do nothing else, but put Box 1 after Box 2 in the code, it would render as expected:</p>
  
  <div class="wrap" style="position:relative;">
    <div class="box" style="position:relative; left:20px;">Box 2 - <code>position:relative; left:20px;</code></div>
    <div class="box" style="position:absolute; top:0; right:0; background:indianred;">Box 1 - <code style="color:#fff;">position:absolute; top:0; right:0;</code></div>
    <div class="box">Box 3</div>
  </div>

  <p>But you may not always be able to move markup around after it is built, or it might ruin other breakpoints, etc.</p>
  <p>Instead, you can tell the browser to give Box 1 priority, even though it doesn't deserve it based on its document order, with the <code>z-index</code> property, by giving it a higher value:</p>

  <div class="wrap" style="position:relative;">
    <div class="box" style="z-index:1; position:absolute; top:0; right:0; background:indianred;">Box 1 - <code style="color:#fff;">z-index:1; position:absolute; top:0; right:0;</code></div>
    <div class="box" style="position:relative; left:20px;">Box 2 - <code>position:relative; left:20px;</code></div>
    <div class="box">Box 3</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    If this seems like a lot to manage, it is. Imagine a whole document mis-managed with positioning, offsets, and arbitrary z-index values.
    Instead, use positioning and z-index only when necessary to achieve a specific goal. In most cases, you can get away with margin and padding instead.

  <h2>position: fixed</h2>

  <p>
    Similar to <code>position:absolute;</code>, fixed-position elements are removed from the document flow, however they are offset from the document, even if it has a relatively-positioned parent element.
    They also stay in the same screen location, even if the page is scrolled!
  </p>

  <p>Find this element on screen at the top-right:</p>
  <div class="box" style="background:gold;">Fixed Position - <code>position:fixed; top:50px; right:0;</code></div>

  <p>It is not constrained to its parent's location below, despite the parent being set to relative position:</p>
  <div class="wrap" style="position:relative;">
    <div class="box" style="position:fixed; top:50px; right:0; background:gold;">Fixed Position - <code>position:fixed; top:50px; right:0;</code></div>
  </div>

  <p>Instead, it is fixed relative to the document itself.</p>

  <aside>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may also notice as you scroll the page, the fixed-positioned element goes behind the red boxes from the previous section. 
    That <code>z-index</code> moves it above all other elements on lower priority!</p>
    <p>Z-index is discussed in further detail on the <a href="07_z-index.html">z-index page</a>.</p>
  </aside>

  <hr>

  <h2>position: sticky</h2>

  <p>
    There is a sort of in-between state between relative/absolute elements (don't stay on screen when scrolled),
    and fixed elements (do stay on screen when scrolled). With <em>sticky</em> positioning, 
    the element is treated as relative (in the normal document flow) until the page's scroll position reaches this element's location. 
    Then as the page scrolls further down, this sticky element behaves like a fixed-positioned element and stays on screen.
  </p>

  <p>This element sticks when reached:</p>
  <div style="position:relative; margin:0 0 20px; overflow:auto; height:240px; border:2px solid red;">
    <p class="spacer" style="min-height:80px;">Normal content above sticky element. Scroll this content area.</p>
    <div class="box" style="position:-webkit-sticky; position:sticky; top:0; color:#fff; background:purple;">Sticky Positioned - <code>position:-webkit-sticky; position:sticky; top:0;</code></div>
    <p>The sticky element must have a positioning property set, one of: <code>top, right, bottom, or left</code></p>
    <p>The parent element must also not have <code>overflow:hidden;</code> set;</p>
    <p class="spacer" style="min-height:600px;">Adding scroll depth for testing.</p class="spacer">
  </div>

  <p class="spacer" style="min-height:400px;">Adding scroll depth for testing.</p class="spacer">
