        Most browsers add a default margin to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. This is typically normalized with CSS (removed), since it is not standardized across browsers, 
        and the site design typically doesn't call for it.
      </li>
      <li>
        At their core, web pages are documents and HTML employs certain default rules to facilitate this behavior. Tags generally have specific semantic value, 
        which tells the device how to interpret the content within.
      </li>
      <li>
        The basic building blocks of a document are <strong>block</strong> elements. These tags create boxes, or blocks, of grouped content. 
        They may or may not have semantic value, based on the type of tag used.
      </li>
      <li>
        Without CSS or JavaScript, multiple block elements will not occupy the same horizontal space. Thus, documents have a top-down flow dictated by blocks. 
      </li>
      <li>
        As a container, block elements take the width of their parent environment, or scope, by default. 
        In the above example, that parent is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, which as a block element itself, has the full device width!
        This pattern continues up the document hierarchy until the terminus is reached; the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        The most common block elements are <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. While both act as containers, their semantics dictate their usage. 
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags are generic layout containers that provide no semantic value. You cannot infer the inner content-grouping's meaning from the tag itsef.</li>
          <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags, however, tell the device to expect paragraph content, which in turn may have inline-element semantics. With this tag you can infer semantics from the tag itself.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Devices typically add base styling to different tags, once their semantics are determined. For example, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags lack margins, since they act as generic groupings, while <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> 
        tags tend to have a top and margin applied, since the device anticipates their usage with other paragraph and headline tags.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the above example, we have 3 <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> boxes that by default don't have vertical spacing (margins). 
        If you inspect them with Dev Tools, you'll see them stacked flush on top of each other.
      </li>
    </ul>
