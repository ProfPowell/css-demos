  <p>
    At their core, web pages are documents. You encode your content with specific rules (HTML tags) that tell devices how to interpret and render it. 
    Like a normal document, you define a hierarchy structure (tree) of weighted headlines and content (paragraphs, lists, tables, etc.).
  </p>

  <h2>Block tags</h2>

  <p>
    The basic building blocks of a document are <strong>block</strong> elements. These tags create boxes, or blocks, which may contain grouped child content. 
    They may or may not have semantic value, based on the type of tag used.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most common block elements are <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. While both act as containers, their semantics dictate their usage. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags are generic layout containers that provide no semantic value. You cannot infer the inner content-grouping's meaning from the tag itsef.</li>
    <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags, however, tell the device to expect paragraph content, which in turn may have inline-element semantics. With this tag you can infer semantics from the tag itself.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    By itself (without additional CSS or JavaScript), multiple block elements will never occupy the same horizontal space. 
    Thus, block elements always 'stack' on top of each other, separated by line breaks. 
  </p>

  <p>
    As a container, block elements take the width of their parent environment, or scope, by default. 
    In the above example, that parent is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, which as a block element itself has the full device width.
    This pattern continues up the document hierarchy until the terminus is reached; the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag.
  </p>

  <p>Devices typically add base styling to different tags, once their semantics are determined.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags lack margins, since they act as generic grouping boxes</li>
    <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags tend to have a top and bottom margin applied, since the device anticipates their usage with other paragraph and headline tags.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In the above example, there are 2 <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> boxes that don't have vertical spacing (margins) by default.
    If you change the tags to <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, you will see margins appear.
  </p>

  <p>With CSS, you can turn any element into a block element with the display property: <code>display: block;</code></p>

  <aside>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Devices tend to add their own styling to specific tags. 
    Because this can be inconsistent across different browsers, you shouldn't rely on this alone.
    If the styling is important, it should be applied with CSS.</p>
